## Overview
The idea for creating this application is to provide people with a tool that allows them to create and track "simple" events (i.e. birthday parties, cookouts, tailgates, etc..) in order to mitiage the confusion and miscommunication that is found in today's current group texts/chats. All of the logistical information is provided for its users through this interactive and organized platform. 

When creating an event, the user must provide information about the event such as the event date, time, location, and any items/food needed to make the event possible. Once the event is created, that event will be available for anyone to search in which the event summary will be displayed on a simple and organized page for the guests to view. 

## In Progress / Pseudocode
This application is extremely simple and has a lot more room for scalability, but unfortunately we did not have enough time to add everything we wanted to. There are a few bugs with the application that still need to be fixed and we still want to add more functionality to it. Below is a list of areas for improvement:

1. Create a smoother UX/UI - we want the user to be in control but we want to help with guiding them to their objectives to reduce their cognitive load. For example, when the user loads into the main screen, we should provide them with the two options to create or earch for an event on the main screen rather than have them figure out which menu options will take them to the search/create event interface.
2. Resolve event page summary - currently the items for the event do not appear on the event summary with the search function.
3. Allow guests to sign off on what items they want to bring to the event and display that someone is responsible for bringing that item.
4. Update event functionality - allow the event creater to update the event.
5. Improve the user log in authentication for mandatory log in.
6. Add user preference functionality based on login profile - let people save events for easier accessibility.
7. Allow event creaters to invite other users to the event.
